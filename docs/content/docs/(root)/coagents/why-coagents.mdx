title: Why CoAgents?
---

Co-agents are agents specifically designed to work alongside people inside Agent-Native applications
(rather than autonomously). CopilotKit’s CoAgents is agentic UX infrastructure for turning agents built
with the top agentic framework (LangGraph), into co-agents.

The core CopilotKit runloop is itself an example of a [ReAct agent](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-s-a-react-agent-5hu7ZOaKSAuY7YdFjQLCNQ)
- which is designed to be very simple to implement. You should use CoAgents when you require tight 
control over your agent’s behavior, of the kind offered by Agentic Orchestration framework. An excellent
example of the type of experiences you can accomplish with CoAgent applications can be found in our 
[Research Canvas](/examples/coagents-research-canvas). More specifically, it demonstrates how CoAgents
allow for AI driven experiences with:

- Fine-grained state management
- Multi-step reasoning flows
- Complex tool orchestration
- Human-in-the-loop interactions
- Intermediate streaming of state

All of these features are essential to delight instead of frustrate your users with AI features. In the
following sections we’ll go over how CoAgents tackle each of these concepts as well as how you can get
started utilizing them in a matter of hours and not months.
