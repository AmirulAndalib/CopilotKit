No need to do anything else -- chat with an agent Just Works!

TODO: add gif.

If you've followed the quickstarts / getting-started, you should already have Copilot UI integrated in your app connected to a LangGraph agent.
**Simply write a message and observe the agent responding back! ðŸŽ‰**

You can of course use any of the [built-in Copilot UI components](/guides/custom-look-and-feel/built-in-ui-components), [headless UI](/guides/custom-look-and-feel/headless-ui), etc.
