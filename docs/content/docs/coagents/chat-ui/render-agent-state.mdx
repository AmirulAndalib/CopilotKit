title: Agentic Generative UI
description: Render the current agent state in your application
---


## Background 

CoAgents offers <u>**agentic generative UI**</u> based on the **agent's current state**, in addition to the standard generative UI using `useCopilotAction` **(based on the tool-calling abstraction)**.

Continuously rendering the agent's state is the **gold standard for agentic UX**. It keeps users **engaged** and **builds trust** by showing that the agent is on the right track.

<Callout type="info">
  By default, the LangGraph agent state updates only **betwee** LangGraph node transitions. However, for a more engaging user experience, you'll likely want to render the state as it updates **continuously**.

  To learn how to stream and render intermediate agent states, providing real-time updates to your users, refer to our guide on [Streaming Intermediate State](/coagents/advanced/intermediate-state-streaming).

## Rendering Agent State with `useCoAgentStateRender`

To render state in your application, use the `useCoAgentStateRender` hook. Here's a simple example using untyped objects:

```tsx
"use client"; // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]

import { useCoagentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

useCoagentStateRender({ // [!code highlight:11]
  name: "basic_agent", # the name of the agent
  nodeName: "optionally_specifiy_a_specifc_node", # Optional! You can specify a specific node you want generative UI for. Omit this argument if you want to render the agent's state for any node.
  render: ({ status, state, nodeName }) => {
    return (
      <WeatherDisplay
        conditions={state.final_response.conditions}
        temperature={state.final_response.temperature}
      />
    );
  },
});
```

The render function can return any valid React node; you can use your own components to display the agent's state.

## Stream & render the intermediate agent state
By default, the LangGraph agent state will only update *between* LangGraph node transitions.

You will likely want to render the state as it updates continuously.<br/>
**See [Stream intermediate state](/coagents/advanced/intermediate-state-streaming)**


## Using Typed State with Generics

To get better type safety and IntelliSense support, you can provide TypeScript types to `useCoAgentStateRender`.

Define your agent's state types:

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python (Pydantic)"]}>
  <Tab value="TypeScript">

  ```ts
  type WeatherResponse = {
    conditions: string;
    temperature: number;
    wind_direction: string;
    wind_speed: number;
  };

  type AgentState = {
    final_response: WeatherResponse;
    input: string;
    messages: any[];
  };
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Python (Pydantic)">
  In your LangGraph Python code:
  
  ```python
  class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
      conditions: str = Field(description="Weather conditions in the location")
      temperature: float = Field(description="The temperature in fahrenheit")
      wind_direction: str = Field(description="The direction of the wind in abbreviated form")
      wind_speed: float = Field(description="The speed of the wind in km/h")

  class AgentState(MessagesState):
      final_response: WeatherResponse
      input: str
  ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

Now, you can use generics with `useCoAgentStateRender`:

```tsx
"use client"; // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]

import { useCoagentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

useCoagentStateRender<AgentState>({ // [!code highlight:9]
  name: "basic_agent", # the name of the agent
  nodeName: "optionally_specifiy_a_specifc_node", # Optional! You can specify a specific node you want generative UI for. Omit this argument if you want to render the agent's state for any node.
  render: ({ status, state, nodeName }) => {
    return (
      <DetailedWeatherInfo data={state.final_response} />
    );
  },
});
```
This way, you'll get type checking and auto-completion for `state` properties.

In this example, `DetailedWeatherInfo` is a component you define to display detailed weather information using the typed state.
