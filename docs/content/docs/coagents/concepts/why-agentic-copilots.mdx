        ### What is 'Agentic Copilots'?
        Agentic Copilots are CopilotKit's integration layer for LangGraph agents.

        If you've been using CopilotKit to build your Copilot, you alrady know what an agentic copilot is: a runloop that understands your application's context, and can take action within it, utilizing a ~human-like intelligence.
        The core CopilotKit runloop is itself an example of a [ReAct agent](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-s-a-react-agent-5hu7ZOaKSAuY7YdFjQLCNQ)
        which is designed to be very versetile and straightforward to implement -- but which offers less tight control over the agentic runloop.

        ### When should I use CopilotKit's Agentic Copilots?
        You should use Agentic Copilots when you require tight control over the Agentic runloop, as facilitated by an Agentic Orchestration framework like [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).
        With Agentic Copilots, you can carry all of your existing CopilotKit-enabled Copilot capabilities into a customized agentic runloop.

        We suggest beginning with a basic Copilot and gradually transitioning specific components to Agentic Copilots.
        
        The need for Agentic Copilots spans a broad spectrum across different applications. At one end, their advanced capabilities might not be required at all, or only for a minimal 10% of the application's functionality. Progressing further, there are scenarios where they become increasingly vital, managing 60-70% of operations. Ultimately, in some cases, Agentic Copilots are indispensable, orchestrating up to 100% of the Copilot's tasks (see [agent-lock mode](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock#agent-lock-mode) for the 100% case).

        ### Examples
        An excellent example of the type of experiences you can accomplish with Agentic Copilot
        applications can be found in our [Research Canvas](/examples/coagents-research-canvas).
        
        More specifically, it demonstrates how Agentic Copilots allow for AI driven experiences with:
        - Precise state management across agent interactions
        - Sophisticated multi-step reasoning capabilities
        - Seamless orchestration of multiple AI tools
        - Interactive human-AI collaboration features
        - Real-time state updates and progress streaming

        LangChain's LangGraph is a framework for building deeply customizable AI agents.

        CopilotKit's Agentic Copilots is infrastruture for in-app agent-user interaction, i.e. for transforming agents from autonomous processes to user-interactive 'virtual colleagues' that live inside applications.

        Any LangGraph-based agent can be transformed into an Agentic Copilot with a minimal amount
        of effort to get industry leading agnetic UX such as:
        - Shared state between the agent and the application.
        - Intermediate result and state progress streaming
        - Human-in-the-loop collaboration
        - Agentic generative UI

        And more.

        All of these features are essential to delight instead of frustrate your users with AI features. In the following
        sections we'll go over how Agentic Copilots tackle each of these concepts as well as how you can get started utilizing
        them in a matter of hours and not months.
