## Before you start

At the moment CoAgents integrates with LangGraph-powered agents using **LangGraph-Python**. <br/>
(Support for LangGraph.js and LangGraph Cloud is coming very soon! [Contact us]() for early access).


**For orientation, here's how CoAgents are wired:**

<CoAgentsDiagram />


<Callout type="info">
This guide assumes youâ€™re familiar with using LangGraph to build agent workflows. If you need a quick introduction, check out [this brief example from the LangGraph docs](https://docs.langgraph.ai/quickstart).
</Callout>





## Getting started

<Steps>

<Step>

First, take a minute to **[go through the CopilotKit quickstart](/quickstart), and integrate CopilotKit into your React app.**
This should only take a minute.

</Step>

<Step>
Then, setup a CopilotKit Remote-Endpoint using FastAPI.
Follow the [Remote Endpoint quickstart](/guides/backend-actions/remote-backend-endpoint). <br/>
**This endpoint will serve your (Python) LangGraph agent.**
</Step>


<Step>


## Connect your FastAPI Remote Endpoint to a LangGraph agent


At this point you should have CopilotKit hooked into your application, connected to a FastAPI Remote Endpoint.

The next step is to configure the Remote Endpoint to serve LangGraph agents.

**Modify your server.py file (setup in step (2)) to serve LangGraph agents:**

```python title="server.py"
from fastapi import FastAPI
from copilotkit.integrations.fastapi import add_fastapi_endpoint
from copilotkit import CopilotKitSDK, LangGraphAgent

app = FastAPI()

# Import your LangGraph agent; in this example, it's the variable
# named `basic_agent_graph` in ./agent.py
from .agent import basic_agent_graph

# Initialize the agent for use by CopilotKit; we'll name it "basic_agent"
basic_agent = LangGraphAgent( // [!code-highlight:4]
    name="basic_agent",
    description="Agent that asks about the weather",
    agent=basic_agent_graph,
)

# Initialize the CopilotKit SDK
sdk = CopilotKitSDK(agents=[basic_agent]) [!code-highlight:1]

# Add the CopilotKit endpoint to your FastAPI app
add_fastapi_endpoint(app, sdk, "/copilotkit_remote")

def main():
    """Run the uvicorn server."""
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run("server:app", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, reload=True)

```

<Callout>
  Remember the name `basic_agent` as well as our API endpoint URL (`http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`), we'll need them as we move on to integrating this agent into the frontend.
</Callout>

</Step>



<Step>

## Agent-lock your Copilot to the `base_agent` agent.

CopilotKit supports router-mode as well as agent-lock mode. For more detail see [router-mode / agent-mode](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock).

In short: agent-lock modes locks your Copilot to a single LangGraph agent.
Router-mode automatically routes requests to the right agent based on the user's context and query.

**For simplicity, wel'll use agent-lock mode in these tutorials,** but in production use-cases you will likely want to use router-mode.

Lock the Copilot to the `basic_agent` setup earlier. This means every single interaction with the Copilot will be forwarded to the locked agent.

```tsx filename="src/page.tsx"
// This UI will now invoke our AI agent, not just the LLM
<CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="basic_agent">
  <CopilotChat
    labels={{
      title: "Popup Assistant",
      initial: "Need any help?",
    }}
  />
</CopilotKit>
```

</Step>
</Steps>

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! You've successfully integrated a LangGraph agent chatbot to your application!
Give it a try by writing text in the chatbot UI and pressing send.
You are now chatting with a LangGraph agent!
